# Where did the name 'Project Oculus' come from?

Oculus (Latin for 'eye' or 'architectural opening') is an idea explored in Vitruvius's book 'De Architectura' (famous for the 'Vitruvian Man'.) 
It is where the key design feature 'oculus' comes from in architecture, which means a cirucular opening, usually in a **dome** or wall, allowing light and vision into a structure. A famous example would be the Patheon in Rome which was a dome with a circular opening at the top that allows natural light to flood in.

In book 10 of 'De Architectura' it discusses about ancient forms of surveillance and defensive structures like watch towers and city defenses. 
As such, I believe 'Project Oculus' is a fitting name for this project, as security cameras are typically **domes** or **watchful eyes** that provide surveillance and security for modern day structures.

# How does it work?

A network of RaspberryPi cameras that use a webserver to livestream the recording, as well as store video content into another RaspberryPi that acts as a reverse proxy with some storage.
